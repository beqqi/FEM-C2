## My process
After downloanding the required files, the figma file made it easier for me to implement with adequate accuracy. Compared to my last project, I was able to play around with different positioning although I am still learning.

### Built with
This is build with HTML5 and CSS3.


### What I learned

I have learnt to use flexbox along with other basic types of layout.

### Continued development

As this is just my 2nd challenge, I didn't bother to make the layout responsive that I would like to work on the coming challenges.
